Brief description of the game (more details to come later).

-	Have a list of random “monsters”. 
-	Go from encounter to encounter. 
-	At the end you have a high score. 
-	Roll dice to defeat monster. (6 sided, 0-5)
  o	Player rolls a number and subtracts that from the monster’s health
  o	2 dice for player, 2 for monster. Dice are additive.
  o	3 rules:
      - Rolling 2 of the same number doubles the damage. 
      -	Roll all zeros to get health back
      - 100 sided die for miss % 
          •	If you roll above 90 the hit misses.
